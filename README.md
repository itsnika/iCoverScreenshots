"iCover" was a Social Networking site build on top of Adequate framework (framework developed by Gerald Nika) with the aim of helping new artists promote themselves through uploading and exploring musical covers. It covers in detail all the aspects and functionality of a complete Social Network and is responsive in all devices and resolutions, flat and minimalistic.
